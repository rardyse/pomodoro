# pomodoro


IN CONSTRUCTION 


## quick presentation :

this project was created as a little productivity buddy for myself during long study sessions or work blocks, because I found the default one on my computer VERY boring. 
i really wanted to create one from scratch to have hands on it directly while being aware that "YES LUNA, YOU DID YOURSELF!!!"
the pomodoro method (25 min of focused work, 5 min break, repeat) really helped me keep track of time without burning out during my ongoing studies.  
sooo I thought: why not create a *cute desktop app* just for that?

it keeps me on track, gently nudges me when it's break time, and makes the whole workflow smoother and more intentional while having some cute features / designs!!!!!!

with this project, i learned how to handle timers, desktop notifications, and simple interface-building in python (I will see of I push further the project with other programmation languages), and of course, how to actually stick to my own schedule 


## features :

- customizable work and break intervals (you decide! 25/5? 50/10? 90/20? it’s all yours)
- visual countdown timer displayed on screen  
- desktop notifications to let you know when it's time to focus or chill  ;)
- (optional) sound alert to vibe with your breaks 
- minimal & distraction-free interface  
- cute and clean (i don't like the word "girly" to describe it)


## technologies used :

- `tkinter` – to build the graphical user interface (GUI)  
- `time` – for countdown logic  
- `threading` – to run the timer without freezing the UI  
- `plyer` – to send desktop notifications  
- `pygame` – (optional) to add playful sound alerts for start/break times  
- `customtkinter` – (optional) to make everything look a bit prettier and more modern


## inspiration :

✨ me, myself and i ✨  
and a desperate need to stop doomscrolling while pretending to revise hahahaha


### of course you are absolutely free to re-use it and re-style it as you need and wish :)
### take it, break it, remix it, add flowers or a cat emoji or whatever suits your vibe.  


a pleasure as always!
