# pomodoro

## quick presentation :

this project was created as a little productivity buddy for myself during long study sessions or work blocks 🧠🍅  
the pomodoro method (25 min of focused work, 5 min break, repeat) really helped me keep track of time without burning out.  
sooo I thought: why not create a *cute desktop app* just for that?

it keeps me on track, gently nudges me when it's break time, and makes the whole workflow smoother and more intentional.

with this project, i learned how to handle timers, desktop notifications, and simple interface-building in python – and of course, how to actually stick to my own schedule 😭✨

## features :

- customizable work and break intervals  
  (you decide! 25/5? 50/10? 90/20? it’s all yours)
- visual countdown timer displayed on screen  
- desktop notifications to let you know when it's time to focus or chill  
- (optional) sound alert to vibe with your breaks 🎵  
- minimal, distraction-free interface  
- cute and clean – because it should feel good to look at while you work!

---

## technologies used :

- `tkinter` – to build the graphical user interface (GUI)  
- `time` – for countdown logic  
- `threading` – to run the timer without freezing the UI  
- `plyer` – to send desktop notifications  
- `pygame` – (optional) to add playful sound alerts for start/break times  
- `customtkinter` – (optional) to make everything look a bit prettier and more modern

## inspiration :

✨ me, myself and i ✨  
and a desperate need to stop doomscrolling while pretending to revise 🙃

## feel free :

yep! take it, break it, remix it, add flowers or a cat emoji or whatever suits your vibe.  
if it helps *you* stay focused or makes your day a bit better – then that’s already a win.  

a pleasure as always,
